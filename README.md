Notes

Ensure Java 17 and Maven are installed on your system.

H2 console is in-memory, so data resets when the application stops.

Swagger UI allows easy testing of all API endpoints.

You can use Postman for additional testing if needed.

.class, .project, .factorypath, and .settings/ files are IDE-specific and not required for running the project.
